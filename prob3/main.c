/*
3) histogram data

	The data provided contains a large number of random numbers. Your program should read the data and count the data within each of 16 'bins'.  
	That is the frequency of data lying between 0 - 16  ,  17 - 32,  33 - 48  etc. upto 255. The result should be outputted to a file containing 3 columns representing
	the bin start and end and the frequency.
	Finally the program should display the data as a bar graph like so:

	0-16	=======
	17-32	===========
	33-48	=============

	 ...

	etc
